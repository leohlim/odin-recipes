    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta carbonara is an indulgent yet surprisingly simple recipe. Made with pancetta 
        (or bacon) and plenty of Parmesan, this recipe takes only 30 minutes to prepare from 
        start to finish!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil. 
            Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and Parmesan. 
            Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.</li>
        <li>Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the pork, and saut√© until the 
            fat just renders, on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in 
            skillet, if needed. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat. 
            Stir for a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved 
            pasta water if needed for creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and 
            pepper.</li>
    </ol>
